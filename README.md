  <h1>AI Object Detection</h1>
 </div>
 
> This Project uses JavaScript, ml5.js, and the COCO-SSD model to detect objects in real time using your device camera.

##  REQUIREMENTS
+ Modern Browser (Chrome Recommended)
+ Camera Access
+ Internet (to load ml5.js library)

***

### ML5.JS

ml5.js is a high-level JavaScript machine learning library built on top of TensorFlow.js.
It provides easy access to powerful pre-trained models directly in the browser.

Key Features of ml5.js:
>COCO-SSD Support, Browser-based ML, Real-time Object Detection, Easy-to-use API.

### COCO-SSD MODEL

COCO-SSD is a deep learning model trained on the COCO dataset with 80+ common objects such as person, bottle, phone, chair, dog, cat, etc.
It is highly optimized for real-time detection even on low-end devices.

Key Features of COCO-SSD:
>Detects 80 classes, High Accuracy, Lightweight, Fast Inference.

### HTML5 CANVAS

HTML5 Canvas is used to draw the video frame and overlay the detection bounding boxes and labels.

Key Features of Canvas:
>Renders Video Frames, Draws Bounding Boxes, Displays Labels & Confidence Percentages.

### MEDIA DEVICES API

The navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia() API is used to access the device camera and stream video directly to the webpage.

Key Features of MediaDevices API:
>Open Camera Stream, Support for Front/Back Cameras, Works on Mobile and Desktop.

### MATERIALIZE CSS

Materialize CSS is used for styling the UI, including loader animation and centered title alignment.

Key Features of Materialize:
>Clean UI, Responsive Design, Ready-made Components.
